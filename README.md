Hello,

- I am a web developer turned technical writer with a passion for technology. I am a team player, and always looking for ways to learn.

- I have published articles in [Hashnode](https://doroh.hashnode.dev/) and [The python code](https://www.thepythoncode.com/author/chepkirui-dorothy/articles). 

- I have also written articles on [Customizing the Django Admin](https://earthly.dev/blog/customize-django-admin-site/) and [ A developer's guide to Git LFS ](https://earthly.dev/blog/a-developer-guide-to-git-lfs/) for Earthly Technologies. 

- I am contributing to the open-source site, FreeCodeCamp. They are  [How to Perform CRUD Operations with Django Models](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/models-in-django/)  and  [Learn Python Basics â€“ A Guide for Beginners](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-python-basics/).

- I recently wrote an article for Twilio - [How to Build an IVR with Django and Programmable Voice](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/blog/django-interactive-voice-response-pizza-programmable-voice).
